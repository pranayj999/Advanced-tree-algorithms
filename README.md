# Tree Algorithms for Efficient Data Structure Operations

This repository contains unique implementations of two advanced tree data structures:

1. **S-Tree (Suffix Tree):** Efficiently manages substring and pattern matching operations.
2. **hp-Tree (Heavy Path Decomposition):** Optimized for analyzing and processing heavy paths, ideal for genome mapping and hierarchical data analysis.

These implementations are designed for practical applications, educational purposes, and scalable problem-solving in computer science and bioinformatics.

## Features

- **S-Tree:** Compact and efficient suffix tree construction for substring queries.
- **hp-Tree:** Decomposes trees into heavy paths for optimized traversal and operations.
- Fully documented Python code with usage examples.
- Applicable to tasks like genomic sequence analysis and data structure optimization.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```

cd tree-algorithms

```
Usage

1. S-Tree
The S-Tree is a suffix tree implementation designed to efficiently handle substring queries and pattern matching.

Example Usage:
```
from s_tree import SuffixTreeCustom

# Create a suffix tree for the string
tree = SuffixTreeCustom("ACGTACGTG")
print("S-Tree Structure:")
tree.visualize_tree()
```
2. hp-Tree
The hp-Tree (Heavy Path Decomposition Tree) focuses on identifying and processing heavy paths in a tree structure for efficient traversal and query optimization.

Example Usage:
```
from hp_tree import HeavyPathDecomposer

# Create and decompose the tree
tree = HeavyPathDecomposer()
tree.add_node(1)  # Root node
tree.add_node(2, 1, weight=8)
tree.add_node(3, 1, weight=3)
tree.add_node(4, 2, weight=5)
tree.find_heavy_paths()
tree.display_heavy_paths()

```
How It Works

S-Tree
Builds a suffix tree from the input string.
Each node represents a substring, and indices indicate where the substring occurs in the original string.
Efficient for finding patterns, longest common substrings, or repetitive patterns.
hp-Tree
Decomposes a tree into "heavy paths," focusing on the paths with maximum weight (number of descendants).
Reduces the complexity of traversals by focusing on high-priority paths.
Ideal for hierarchical data and large-scale pattern matching.
